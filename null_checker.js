Using if..else, write the code which gets a number using prompt and then shows in console.log:

    1, if the value is greater than zero,
    -1, if less than zero,
    0, if equals zero.

In this task we assume that the input is always a number.

var myNumber = 7;
if(myNumber>0) {console.less(1);}//line 5
if(myNumber<0){console.log(-1)} //line 6
