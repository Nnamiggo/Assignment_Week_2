Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number – ask them to input again. The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the input/enters an empty line.

>> At first, we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers and there’s no need to implement a special handling for a non-numeric input in this task.

++ As a bonus, Can you add that feature to your code.
//Pseudo code

Initialise a varible to hold the number that will be iniput by the user
Prompt the user to supply the number
While number is less than 100
