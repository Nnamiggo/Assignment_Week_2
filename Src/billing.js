/*Create your project structure and complete assignment

In this assignment, you are going to create a simple billing calculator that deducts transaction charges from the amount tendered by a customer. The assignment will test your understanding of the concepts covered so far.

    To start, open the terminal on your computer, change to the directory where you want to store this assignment and create a new directory named "Assignment_Week_2"
    Change your current directory to the newly created directory "Assignment_Week_2"
    Inside of "Assignment_Week_2" directory, create another directory called Src and create a file called billing.js using the touch command or with your favorite text editor
    In src/billing.js create a constant called transactionCharge and set it equal to 2.5%
    In the line before the creation of the constant (line 1), leave a single line comment This is the percentage that determines the transaction charge
    Create a variable amountTendered and set it equal to 100000
    Use console.log to print the following message: 'This is what the billed amount is (less transaction charges);'
    On the next line - again, use the console.log to print the result of the billed amount is which is as a result of subtracting the transaction charge from the Amount tendered.
    To run your code, you have to run the following command from your terminal node billing.js
    It is important that you are within the src directory when implementing the command
    The result should be as indicated below
    If correct, submit your file billing.js to your github repository under a new repository "Intro to javascript"
