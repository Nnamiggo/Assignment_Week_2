/*Create your project structure and complete assignment




    In the line before the creation of the constant (line 1), leave a single line comment 

    Create a variable amountTendered and set it equal to 100000
    
    Use console.log to print the following message: 'This is what the billed amount is (less transaction charges);'
    On the next line - again, use the console.log to print the result of the billed amount is which is as a result of subtracting the transaction charge from the Amount tendered.
    To run your code, you have to run the following command from your terminal node billing.js
    It is important that you are within the src directory when implementing the command
    The result should be as indicated below
    If correct, submit your file billing.js to your github repository under a new repository "Intro to javascript"
    Share the link to your repository in the Slack channel unit_2_days_11-15*/

    //My Pseudo code
    Declare a constant to hold the (2.5/100) constant for it is a parcentange...after the comment
    Declare amountTendered variable initialising it to 100000
    Use console.log to print the following message: 'This is what the billed amount is (less transaction charges);'
    On the next line - again, use the console.log to print the result of the billed amount is which is as 
    a result of subtracting the transaction charge from the Amount tendered.
    submiting tthis file into a new repository called Intro to javascript requires submodules...complex topic!

    // This is the percentage that determines the transaction charge
